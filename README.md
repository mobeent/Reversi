# Reversi
Using node.js to make a web game reversi
Part 1: Two player Reversi using socket.IO
Part 2: Arbitrary number of simultaneous games.
Part 3: Use mongodb to store game and client state (use JSON where appropriate) so stopping 
and restarting the server does not affect games in progress. Clients automatically keep 
trying to reconnect if the server connection drops.
